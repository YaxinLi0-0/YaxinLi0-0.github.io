# Header 1

This is a normal paragraph following a header. GitHub is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. It lets you and others work together on projects from anywhere.

## Header 2

> This is a blockquote following a header.

> When something is important enough, you do it even if the odds are not in your favor.

### Header 3

```js
// Javascript code with syntax highlighting.
var fun = function lang(l) {
  dateformat.i18n = require('./lang/' + l)
  return true;
}
```

```ruby
# Ruby code with syntax highlighting
GitHubPages::Dependencies.gems.each do |gem, version|
  s.add_dependency(gem, "= #{version}")
end

### Here is an unordered list:

*   Item foo
*   Item bar
*   Item baz
*   Item zip

### And an ordered list:

1.  Item one
1.  Item two
1.  Item three
1.  Item four

### And a nested list:

- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
    - level 3 item
    - level 3 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item
  - level 2 item
  - level 2 item
- level 1 item

# About Me

I'm Yaxin Li, a PhD student from the Department of Computer Science and Engineering at Michigan State University. My advisor is [Dr. Jiliang Tang](https://www.cse.msu.edu/~tangjili/), whose research interests focus on Machine Learning on Graph and Trustworty AI.

My research interests focus on trust-worthy deep learning, especially robustness and privacy. My goal is to discover potential harm of AI systems and prevent different types of data from being misused by AI.

Before I joined MSU, I completed my BS (2019) in the Department of Automation at Tsinghua University.
